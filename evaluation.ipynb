Use [sklearn’s train_test_split function](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) to split your data frame into a training, validation and test set. You will need to use the function twice. You should now have 3 different variables for the features (x_train,x_val,x_test) and 3 different variables for the labels (y_train,y_val,y_test).\n",

Import [sklearn’s metrics for accuracy and the AUC score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#sklearn-metrics-metrics), and use them to compare the true and the predicted labels of the validation set.

To get a better idea of the performance, train/evaluate the classifiers multiple times, and plot the mean + standard deviation of the metric (rather than just the average accuracy/AUC)"
